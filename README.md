-	This web application is a Target-Heart-Rate Calculator.
-	While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors.
-	The formula for calculating the maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years for men, and 226 minus your age for women.
-	Your target heart rate is a range that is 55 – 70% of your maximum heart rate.
-	Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name, year of birth and the current year (find the current year from the system and NOT by asking the user to enter it).
-	Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters.
-	For each attribute provide a property with set and get accessors.
-	The class also should include a method that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and returns the person’s maximum heart rate and methods that calculate and return the person’s minimum and maximum target heart rates.
-	Use radio buttons to allow the user to select the gender, and textboxes to enter the person’s information, instantiate an object of class HeartRates and displays the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and year of birth—then calculates and displays the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
-	Use Validation on each input field from the user.
-	Give proper names to all the controls used in the webform.
-	Customize the webform according to your own imagination. You can change the background color, fonts, font color, or whatever you can think of.
